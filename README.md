Hello!

Thank you for your patience! Before you install this code and use it, there are a few things you need to know before installing it. By using this code, you agree to the policies listed below:

We reserve the right to close down the open source project at any time and close the source. Those who violate our terms of service and privacy policy will be shut down immediately. And if it turns out these users have a Balze account, their account will be banned also. All logos, such as the Balze logo, are solely owned by Balze. Do not use any of our current logos to make your own projects without permission. Speaking of projects, you are free to make your own clients with our code as long as you properly credit the Balze website for the original idea. Examples include: "This is a derivative work of Balze. https://balzeapp.net" or "This project is originally made by balzeapp.net and has been made through open-source permission." or anything similar. Failure to comply will result in a takedown notice. Thank you so much for your help. If you want to update the code and help us contribute, PLEASE do so. We would much appreciate the help. If you have any questions or concerns, email contactbalze@proton.me and we will get back to you within the next 72 hours!
